# 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

An intelligent music recommendation system that detects user emotions and suggests songs accordingly. This project combines computer vision, deep learning, and audio recommendation algorithms to personalize music based on facial expressions.

---

## 📌 Features

- 😄 Detects real-time emotions using webcam or image input
- 🎶 Recommends music that matches the detected emotion
- 🧠 Utilizes deep learning models for facial emotion recognition
- 🔍 Optional voice/text input for emotion classification
- 📁 Easy to extend with custom music datasets or APIs (like Spotify)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:  
  - `OpenCV` – Image processing and webcam handling  
  - `TensorFlow / Keras` – Emotion detection model  
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` – Data manipulation  
  - `Scikit-learn` – Model training and evaluation  
  - `pygame` or `vlc` – Audio playback  
  - `Spotify API / YouTube API` – Music streaming (optional)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Capture the user's facial image (via webcam or upload).
2. Use a pre-trained deep learning model to classify the emotion.
3. Map the detected emotion to a playlist or music genre.
4. Play or recommend songs based on the emotion.
